Hello! I'm Ellen and I'm a yoga instructor and data enthusiast. This is my code for creating a website in R Studio using Blogdown to host a site via Netlify where clients and potential clients can learn more about my services offering private yoga lessons and get in contact with me to schedule an appointment.
